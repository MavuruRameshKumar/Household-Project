As per rule# 4 in the tasks(display data as it is modified i.e add/delete), member will be displayed when he/she is added to the list. Rule# 3 in Notes(Display data on submission) conflicted with
this but followed the prior one.there is an update


Once the user clicks the submit button and tries to do any actions he will be treated as a new user though the previous
user's data is displayed on the screen. It is updated when the user performs any actions.
